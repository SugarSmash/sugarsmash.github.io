            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I connect to LibreLinkUp?</h3>
            <p>To connect Glucose Smash to your LibreLinkUp account:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the app and go to Settings</li>
                <li>Enter your LibreLinkUp email and password</li>
                <li>Tap "Connect" to authenticate</li>
                <li>Your glucose data will begin syncing automatically</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why isn't my data syncing?</h3>
            <p>If your glucose data isn't updating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check that you're connected to the internet</li>
                <li>Verify your LibreLinkUp credentials are correct</li>
                <li>Make sure LibreLinkUp is receiving data from your sensor</li>
                <li>Try logging out and back in through the Settings page</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do achievements work?</h3>
            <p>Achievements are earned by maintaining streaks of days where you meet your glucose goals. There are three types of achievements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perfect Days:</strong> Days where you meet both your average glucose goal AND time in range goal</li>
                <li><strong>Average Glucose:</strong> Days where you meet your average glucose goal</li>
                <li><strong>Time in Range:</strong> Days where you meet your time in range goal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can earn the same achievement multiple times by building new streaks.</p>

            <h3>How do I change my goals?</h3>
            <p>To customize your glucose goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Settings</li>
                <li>Adjust your target glucose range (low and high values)</li>
                <li>Set your daily time in range goal percentage</li>
                <li>Set your average glucose goal</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
            <p>Currently, all data is stored locally on your device. To backup your data, ensure iCloud backup is enabled on your device. We're working on adding data export features in a future update.</p>

            <h3>Why do I need a LibreLinkUp account?</h3>
            <p>Glucose Smash uses LibreLinkUp to access your glucose data from your continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You'll need an active LibreLinkUp account that's receiving data from a compatible CGM device.</p>

            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes! All of your glucose data is stored locally on your device. We never transmit your health data to our servers or any third party. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

            <h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
